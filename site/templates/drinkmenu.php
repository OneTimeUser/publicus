/**
 * Templates render the content of your pages. 
 * They contain the markup together with some control structures like loops or if-statements.
 * The `$page` variable always refers to the currently active page. 
 * To fetch the content from each field we call the field name as a method on the `$page` object, e.g. `$page->title()`.
 * This example templates only echos the field values from the content file and doesn't need any special logic from a controller.
 * Snippets like the header, footer and intro contain markup used in multiple templates. They also help to keep templates clean.
